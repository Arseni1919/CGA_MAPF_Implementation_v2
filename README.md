## P.S.

The code might be a bit unclear for external viewers, but I hope it’s still helpful. I didn’t expect it to be accepted so quickly, and now I’m in a rush to find a job (btw, feel free to contact me if you have an open position). Once I have a moment to breathe, I plan to revise the repository to make it more user-friendly. In the meantime, feel free to use the code as inspiration. If you have any critical questions or issues regarding the repo, please use the `Issues` section.
